# Drum Pad Actions

Drum Pad Actions are just convenience Actions that allow you to apply [Device Chain Actions](/action-reference/device-chain-actions) to the visible Drum Pads in a Drum Rack. To use these Actions, simply replace the `CH` in the associated Device Chain Action with `DR PAD`. For example:

`DEV DR PAD MUTE`

When applying these Actions to ranges of Drum Pads, the range strictly applies to the visible Drum Pads in a Drum Rack. So, when using numbers, the numbers should be in the range of 1 â€“ 16. And, when using the `ALL` keyword, these Actions will be applied just to the visible Drum Pads as opposed to all Drum Pads.
