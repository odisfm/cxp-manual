# Optional Accessories

This section describes optional accessories that can be purchased for use with ClyphX Pro. All of these accessories can be purchased at [Isotonik Studios](https://isotonikstudios.com).

## ClyphX Pro Bindings

[Link to purchase](https://isotonikstudios.com/product/clyphx-pro-bindings/).

The ClyphX Pro Bindings accessory allows controls on a MIDI controller to be dynamically bound and rebound to parameters in Live. This provides functionality that is somewhat similar to MIDI mapping in Live, but is far more dynamic in the sense that your bindings can change over the course of a Live Set (by using the [BIND](/action-reference/global-actions#bind) Action) and you can bind to parameters (such as parameters of the selected Track) that cannot be MIDI mapped.

There are two types of bindings.

### Encoder Bindings

Allows you to bind knobs/faders/encoders to parameters. These bindings are defined
in `Encoder Bindings.txt`, which you'll find within your [settings folder](/core-concepts#settings-foldersfiles).

### Button Bindings 

Allows you to bind buttons to parameters. These bindings are defined in `Button Bindings.txt`, which you'll find within your [settings folder](/core-concepts#settings-foldersfiles). These are really only useful in cases where LED feedback from a parameter is needed. In most cases, X-Controls should be preferred.

## ClyphX Pro G-Controls

The ClyphX Pro G-Controls accessory adds a new type of [X-Trigger](/core-concepts#x-triggers) called G-Controls. G-Controls are similar to [X-Controls](/core-concepts#x-controls), but support enhanced gestures. In addition to an on (aka press) and off (aka release) gesture, G-Controls support a delayed press and can also differentiate between an immediate release and a delayed release. So, G-Controls support 5 gestures in total.

In addition, G-Controls feature a repeat option. This allows you to trigger an [Action List](/core-concepts#action-lists) repeatedly while a button is pressed down.

The settings for G-Controls are defined in `G-Controls.txt`, which you'll find within your [settings folder](/core-concepts#settings-foldersfiles).
