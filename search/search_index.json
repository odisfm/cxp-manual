If you don't see this, please double-check that you've completed the steps listed above. If you do see the colored ring, add a Clip to your Live Set and name it <code>[TEST] METRO</code>. Then launch this Clip and it should toggle the state of the Metronome. If so, everything is working and you can get started using ClyphX Pro in more interesting ways. However, before doing so it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the Core Concepts of ClyphX Pro.</p>"},{"location":"manual/support/","title":"Support","text":""},{"location":"manual/support/#submit-a-support-ticket","title":"Submit a support ticket","text":"<p>https://isotonikstudios.com/my-account/</p>"},{"location":"manual/support/#forum","title":"Forum","text":"<p>https://nativekontrol.proboards.com/</p>"},{"location":"manual/support/#community-discord","title":"Community Discord","text":"<p>Click here to join the Discord server of ClyphX Pro users.</p> <p>If you'd like to ask a question about ClyphX Pro, start a new thread in <code>#questions</code>.</p>"},{"location":"manual/troubleshooting/","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>This section provides resolutions to common problems that you may run into when installing or using ClyphX Pro.
